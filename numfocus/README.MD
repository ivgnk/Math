### üìä Visualisation & image analysis

#### yt                   
is a tool for **querying, analyzing and visualizing objects or regions** of interest to identify emergent properties in data available in a variety of real-world research data formats.             
Initially developed for use by professional astronomers, yt can be applied in a variety of domains including **astrophysics, seismology, nuclear engineering, molecular dynamics, and oceanography**              

#### Bokeh 
is an interactive visualization library               

#### napari 
is an n-dimensional image viewer in Python               

#### HoloViz 
for making sense of data at any scale, primarily through visualization in a web browser

#### scikit-image              
for scientific image analysis                

#### ITK

### üî© Tools (unclude FEM)

#### nteract              
is a stand-alone desktop application for developing computational notebooks. nteract allows users to craft narratives involving text, code, images, and data on the desktop rather than through a web application                  

#### Xarray 
working with multidimensional labeled datasets and arrays in Python             

#### Dask 
advanced parallelism for analytics               

#### FEniCS                  
is an automated finite element library used to solve equations used in modeling, featuring a domain-specific language and automated code generation.              
Users input a problem that looks very much like mathematical notation;              
FEniCS then translates that into computer code. It solves problems for which there is no analytical (exact) solution numerically              

#### CuPy             
is a GPU-based Python library for data analysis in numerical computing. CuPy shares the same API as NumPy and SciPy

### üåç Geosciences

#### GDAL
the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library   https://gdal.org           

#### GeoPandas 
is an open source project to make working with geospatial data in Python easier. It combines the capabilities of pandas and shapely, providing geospatial operations in pandas and a high-level interface to multiple geometries to shapely

### üî¨ Other sciences

#### QuantEcon            
economic modeling https://quantecon.org               

#### PETSc 
to write scientific simulations

#### Econ-ARK            
project is to make it easier for social scientists to do ‚Äòstructural modeling‚Äô of economic choice behavior                     

#### Cantera 
solve problems involving thermodynamics, chemical reaction rates, and fluid transport processes                  

#### OpenMBEE 
Engineering Models and Software      

#### Galaxy                
is a web accessible scientific computing software platform designed for scientists to manage, visualise, analyse and share their own data with minimal technical effort
