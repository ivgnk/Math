### ‚≠ê ML & Math (mainly Bayesian)

#### Scikit‚Äìlearn 
is a Python library for machine learning

#### Shogun Machine Learning Toolbox
It provides efficient implementation of all standard ML algorithm           

#### mlpack             
machine learning library suitable for both data science prototyping and deployment                 

#### SciML          
is an open source software organization created to unify the packages for scientific machine learning                     

### üìä Visualisation & image analysis

#### yt                   
is a tool for **querying, analyzing and visualizing objects or regions** of interest to identify emergent properties in data available in a variety of real-world research data formats.             
Initially developed for use by professional astronomers, yt can be applied in a variety of domains including **astrophysics, seismology, nuclear engineering, molecular dynamics, and oceanography**              

#### Bokeh 
is an interactive visualization library               

#### scikit-image              
for scientific image analysis                

#### ITK 
image analysis              
                 
                    
                       
#### Stan           
is a platform for Bayesian modeling, inference, and visualization on the frontiers of applied statistics                   

#### PyMC
statistical modeling tool for Bayesian statistical modeling and Probabilistic Machine Learning which focuses on advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo and variational fitting algorithms                   

#### ArviZ
A unified codebase for Exploratory analysis of Bayesian models

### üî© Tools (unclude FEM)

#### nteract              
is a stand-alone desktop application for developing computational notebooks. nteract allows users to craft narratives involving text, code, images, and data on the desktop rather than through a web application                  

#### Xarray 
working with multidimensional labeled datasets and arrays in Python             

#### Dask 
advanced parallelism for analytics               

#### FEniCS                  
is an automated finite element library used to solve equations used in modeling, featuring a domain-specific language and automated code generation.              
Users input a problem that looks very much like mathematical notation;              
FEniCS then translates that into computer code. It solves problems for which there is no analytical (exact) solution numerically

### üî¨ Sciences

#### QuantEcon            
economic modeling https://quantecon.org               

#### Econ-ARK            
project is to make it easier for social scientists to do ‚Äòstructural modeling‚Äô of economic choice behavior                     

#### Cantera 
solve problems involving thermodynamics, chemical reaction rates, and fluid transport processes                  

#### OpenMBEE 
Engineering Models and Software
