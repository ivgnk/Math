# Numfocus.org interesting projects  
(Other then main packets as NumPy, Scipy, SymPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Jupyter, IPython, Julia)

## Sponsored-projects

### nteract              
is a stand-alone desktop application for developing computational notebooks. nteract allows users to craft narratives involving text, code, images, and data on the desktop rather than through a web application                  

## Stan           
is a platform for Bayesian modeling, inference, and visualization on the frontiers of applied statistics                   

## PyMC
statistical modeling tool for Bayesian statistical modeling and Probabilistic Machine Learning which focuses on advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo and variational fitting algorithms                   

## Shogun Machine Learning Toolbox
It provides efficient implementation of all standard ML algorithm           

## FEniCS                 
is an automated finite element library used to solve equations used in modeling, featuring a domain-specific language and automated code generation.              
Users input a problem that looks very much like mathematical notation;              
FEniCS then translates that into computer code. It solves problems for which there is no analytical (exact) solution numerically
