![#ff0000](https://placehold.co/15x15/ff0000/ff0000.png) **Testing of optimization functions is necessary                      
because optimization as a kind of solving [incorrect problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-posed_problem)                                         
can give solutions much different from the real ones**
